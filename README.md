# The Bit Library

## Introduction
The Bit Library (TBL) is a multi-language library providing efficient bit abstractions and efficient bit manipulation algorithms. Currently, the library is focusing on the C++ version development and is aiming at standardization. 

## Files
* ``cpp``: C++ version of the library
** ``cpp/bit_details.hpp``: Provides common implementation details and helper classes
** ``cpp/bit_value.hpp``: A class representing an independent, non-referenced bit
** ``cpp/bit_reference.hpp``: A class representing a reference to a bit
** ``cpp/bit_pointer.hpp``: A class representing a pointer to a bit
** ``cpp/bit_iterator.hpp``: A class representing an iterator on bit sequences
** ``cpp/bit_algorithm.hpp``: Optimized versions of algorithms for bit manipulation
** ``cpp/bit.hpp``: 
* ``wg21``: ISO WG21 C++ proposal for standardization
